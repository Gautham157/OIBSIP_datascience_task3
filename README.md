# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This repository contains my submission for **Task 3: Sales Prediction** as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship**. The goal is to build a regression model that predicts sales based on advertisement spending across different media platforms.


# Objective

To analyze how advertising budgets influence product sales and use machine learning (Linear Regression) to predict future sales values.


# Dataset Description

The dataset used contains the following columns:

| Feature     | Description                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| TV          | Advertising budget spent on TV (in $K)   |
| Radio       | Advertising budget spent on Radio (in $K)|
| Newspaper   | Advertising budget spent on Newspaper    |
| Sales       | Sales of the product (in $K)             |




# Technologies Used

- **Python** 
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – Visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning (Linear Regression)



#Workflow

1. **Import the dataset**
2. **Data cleaning and exploration**
3. **Data visualization (correlation, pairplots)**
4. **Model training using Linear Regression**
5. **Model evaluation using R² Score and Mean Squared Error**
6. **Sales prediction using new inputs**



#Results

- The model performs well with a high R² score (indicating strong correlation).
- TV and Radio advertising showed strong positive influence on sales.
- Newspaper ads had a comparatively smaller impact.
